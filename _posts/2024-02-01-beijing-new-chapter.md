After 14 years together and years of separation due to pandemic restrictions, I'm finally moving to Beijing to
reunite with my significant other.

## Personal Journey

February has always marked new beginnings for me. This year feels especially transformative. After years apart due to
pandemic restrictions, I'm finally moving to Beijing to reunite with my significant other. We've been together since
2010, our relationship survived unprecedented global challenges. Now we're building our life together in the same city.

## Professional Transition

This personal milestone coincides with a major professional shift. I'll join EDF's Chinese subsidiary as an IT Manager.
This means stepping away from my role as Software Engineering Coach at TotalEnergies Digital Factory. The position has
been incredibly rewarding. However, opportunities like this don't come often. Working with a renowned international
company while being closer to my loved one was too significant to pass up.

## New Opportunities in China

Beijing offers more than a change of scenery. It's a gateway to one of the world's most dynamic tech ecosystems. I'm
taking a break from coaching to explore the Chinese technology scene. Innovations in artificial intelligence, fintech,
and green technology promise to be challenging and inspiring.

I'm fascinated by the intersection of Eastern and Western tech philosophies. I'll experience this firsthand. I'm
particularly interested in how Chinese corporations implement agile methodologies and DevOps practices compared to
European standards.

Mandarin presents a significant challenge. I'll essentially be illiterate in my new environment. Yet Beijing's modernity
impresses me. Cash barely exists anymore. Everyone uses smartphones primarily. No computers are needed for most tasks.
Most apps integrate within WeChat or Alipay. Chinese ergonomics differ greatly from what we're accustomed to in the
West.

## Continuing Contributions

Rest assured; this blog will continue as a platform for sharing insights. I plan to post once a month, maybe more about
my personal life than before. Such a big change may take considerable time to adjust. I'll keep you updated on
`office-stamper`, some of you may have followed and contributed to this open-source project. I may find new use cases
for it this year since I'm shifting toward more end-user focused work.

## Looking Forward

Change can be daunting, but it's also where growth happens. Here's to new adventures, reunited love, and continuing to
share knowledge across borders.
