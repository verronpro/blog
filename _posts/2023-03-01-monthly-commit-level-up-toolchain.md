---

Migrating to Java 17 LTS, JUnit 5, and a dev container to give enterprise
adopters predictable builds, modern tooling, and zero-friction onboarding to the
project.

**Commits:**

- Java 17: [`49b6c09`]({{gh_os}}/commit/49b6c09)
- JUnit 5: [`428d5d5`]({{gh_os}}/commit/428d5d5)
- Devcontainer docs: [`2f53681`]({{gh_os}}/commit/2f53681)

## Why this stands out

Upgrading the foundation of a project is not glamorous, but it's what keeps the
codebase alive and useful over time. The project moved to Java 17 (last LTS),
ported its tests to JUnit 5, and documented a ready‑to‑code dev container. The
combination matters: a modern runtime unlocks language and performance
improvements; a modern test stack streamlines developer experience; and a
containerized setup makes sporadic contributors effective within minutes instead
of hours.

For a solo project used in big‑company projects, those are not "nice to have"
tweaks — they are survival tools. Enterprises pin on LTS JDKs and require
predictable builds; contractors rotate in and out; security scanners and
compliance checks look for sane defaults. Shipping these changes in one focused
epoch reduces friction for everyone who touches the code or the CLI.

## What the commits reveal

### Java 17: Future-Proofing Without Breaking Production

Commit [49b6c09]({{gh_os}}/commit/49b6c09)

**Problem:** Java 11 reaches EOL; enterprises standardize on LTS versions.  
**Solution:** Unified upgrade across build, CI, and docs.

**Key moves:**

- CI consistency: All workflows → Temurin 17
- Language unlock: Compiler target 1.8 → 17 (enables records, pattern matching)
- Cleaner builds: Removed reflection workaround flags
- Dependency leap: Spring 5 → 6 (security + perf)

**Impact:** No breaking changes for end users; dev environment matches
enterprise standards.

### JUnit 5 migration

Commit [428d5d5]({{gh_os}}/commit/428d5d5)

This large commit completed the transition from JUnit 4 to JUnit 5 across the
entire test suite (50 files changed):

- **Dependency swap:** Replaced `junit:junit:4.13.2` with
  `org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.9.2`, the modern JUnit platform.
- **Annotation migration:** Converted `@Test`, `Assert.*` to JUnit 5's
  `org.junit.jupiter.api.Test` and static assertion imports (`assertEquals`,
  `assertNotNull`, etc.), making tests more expressive and IDE-friendly.
- **Code cleanup:** Reformatted test classes with consistent indentation (tabs),
  removed unused proxy builder stub (`ProxyBuilder.java`), and fixed typos in
  test names (`TabsIndendationTest` → `TabsIndentationTest`).
- **API improvements:** Updated internal utilities like `ExpressionResolver` and
  `CommentUtil` to return `Optional` instead of null, improving null-safety and
  aligning with modern Java idioms.
- **Test structure refinement:** Simplified test assertions and removed
  scattered `Assert.` prefixes in favor of static imports, reducing visual noise
  and making test intent clearer.

The migration was not just find-and-replace; it involved rethinking test
patterns (optional returns, cleaner assertions) and establishing a consistent
style that future contributors can follow without re-learning old conventions.

### Dev Container: From "Works on My Machine" to "Works Everywhere"

Commit [2f53681]({{gh_os}}/commit/2f53681)

The contributor journey:

*Without devcontainer:*

1. Install JDK 17 (which vendor?)
2. Install Maven (which version?)
3. Configure IDE
4. Debug PATH issues
5. ~2 hours later: Run first test

*With devcontainer:*

1. Click "Reopen in Container"
2. 5 minutes later: Run `mvn test ✅`

*The file:* 27 lines that encode the entire environment contract. Works in VS
Code, Codespaces, or any devcontainer-compatible tool.

*Enterprise benefit:* Security teams can audit the environment spec in one file
instead of reverse-engineering setup docs.

## Agile/craftsmanship/docs-as-code lens

- **Small, verifiable changes:** Grouping platform upgrades reduces the
  maintainer's cognitive load and limits the blast radius of issues.
- **Clarity over cleverness:** JUnit 5's parameterized tests and extensions make
  intent visible. When tests read like documentation, they *are*
  documentation-as-code.
- **Eliminate setup tax:** The dev container is executable onboarding. It
  encodes the environment contract so a contributor—or future you—doesn't
  rediscover dependencies on every machine.

> **💭 Maintainer Note:**  
> As a solo maintainer, every hour spent helping someone set up their
> environment is an hour *not* spent fixing bugs or adding features. The dev
> container isn't laziness — it is survival. When a contractor opens a PR, and
> their first message is 'tests pass locally,' not 'how do I install Maven?',
> that's a win.

## Design Decisions

**Decision: Java 17 as minimum runtime**  
*Trade-off:* Excludes Java 8/11 users.  
*Rationale:* LTS support, security patches, modern APIs. Users stuck on older
JDKs can use office-stamper 1.x.  
*Safety net:* Full test suite on Temurin, Corretto, and Azul Zulu.

**Decision: Devcontainer as optional**  
*Trade-off:* Not everyone uses VS Code.  
*Rationale:* Plain Maven remains primary; devcontainer is a productivity boost,
not a requirement.  
*Safety net:* CONTRIBUTING.md documents both paths.

## Your Platform Upgrade Checklist

Planning a similar migration? Use this:

- *Audit dependencies* for LTS compatibility
- *Pin versions* in CI (JDK vendor + version)
- *Migrate tests incrementally* (one package at a time)
- *Run full suite* on multiple JDK vendors (Temurin, Corretto, OpenJDK)
- *Document runtime requirements* separately from dev requirements
- *Provide executable environment* (devcontainer, Dockerfile, or Nix flake)
- *Tag a release* immediately after green CI (makes rollback trivial)
