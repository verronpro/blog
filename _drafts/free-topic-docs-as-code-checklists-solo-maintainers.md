:= August 2024 — Docs‑as‑Code Checklists for Solo Maintainers in
Enterprise Contexts Joseph Verron \<<caring-coder@verron.pro>\>

Note: August 2024 did not land a headline human‑authored commit in the
repository. This article captures the checklists I use to keep
Office‑stamper’s documentation reliable and auditable while maintaining
velocity as a solo maintainer.

# Why this stands out

Documentation is the most leveraged artifact in a solo‑maintained
project used sporadically in big companies. It scales answers, reduces
meeting load, and compresses onboarding for contributors who appear once
every few months. Checklists turn the vague goal of “keep docs good”
into specific, repeatable steps that travel across PRs and releases.
Over time, these micro‑rituals save hours of interruptions and make
enterprise adoption smoother because expectations are explicit.

# The core checklists

## A. Change PR checklist (feature or refactor)

- Update the relevant site page(s) under `engine/src/site/asciidoc/` in
  the same PR as the code change.

- Add/adjust Javadoc for any public API touchpoints
  (`pro.verron.officestamper.api.*`). Keep contracts,
  pre/postconditions, and failure modes explicit.

- Provide one minimal, copy‑pastable example that compiles against
  public types. Keep it under 15 lines; link to deeper references rather
  than duplicating them.

- Validate AsciiDoc locally: build the site; fix broken anchors; keep
  line width near 120 chars for readability.

- If behavior impacts safety/robustness (XML parsing, iteration,
  placeholders), note the risk and mitigation in the docs.

## B. Release checklist

- Update `RELEASE_NOTES.adoc` with a short value narrative (what users
  gain) and any migration notes.

- Ensure the site highlights the month’s most impactful change; link to
  the exact commit on GitHub.

- Rebuild the site and run a link check script to guard against rot
  (links to Javadoc packages, commit URLs, external docs).

- Verify examples still compile with the release version (snippets or
  small test harnesses).

- Add a short “Upgrade notes” section if contracts changed, with code
  before/after.

## C. Template change checklist (docs and examples)

- Show before/after for templates that rely on comments or SDTs; label
  control metadata explicitly.

- Use consistent styles and tight boundaries for control comments in
  examples; remove them in the “after” view.

- Prefer `Paragraph.replace` and `DocxIterator` in examples; avoid
  low‑level DOM manipulation that readers could misapply.

# Agile/craftsmanship/docs‑as‑code lens

- Smaller batches, clearer intent. When docs ship with code, reviewers
  can evaluate the whole change: contract, narrative, and example. That
  makes PRs smaller and decisions easier.

- Shared language. Align site, Javadoc, and code terms—one noun, one
  meaning. Fewer synonyms mean fewer bugs.

- Executable knowledge. Treat examples as tests; when APIs drift, the
  example fails and points to the missing doc update.

# Solo‑maintainer + enterprise usage angle

A solo project lives or dies by how well it teaches itself. In
big‑company settings, teams inherit tools mid‑project and need to be
productive within hours. These checklists ensure the docs always present
a truthful, security‑/compliance‑ friendly picture of the system: what’s
supported, where to extend, and what to avoid. They also help me say
“no” to scope creep in docs—every item must pay for itself in reduced
support or faster reviews.

# Risks and mitigations

- Risk: Checklist fatigue; steps get skipped when under time pressure.
  Mitigation: keep lists short; automate what you can (site build, link
  checker); make checkboxes part of the PR template.

- Risk: Duplication between Javadoc and site. Mitigation: link, don’t
  copy. Contracts in Javadoc; workflows on the site.

- Risk: Stale examples. Mitigation: prefer small, compilable snippets;
  where feasible, include from source.

# How to apply

- Start with one PR checklist and one release checklist. Trim
  ruthlessly—every line must protect user value.

- Add a docs gate in CI: build AsciiDoc, validate internal anchors, and
  curl commit links to ensure 200s.

- Encourage reviewers to request doc adjustments in the same PR. If a
  line of code triggers a “why,” the answer belongs in the docs before
  merge.
