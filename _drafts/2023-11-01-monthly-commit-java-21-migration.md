# Why this is November’s standout

Platform upgrades are the kind of invisible work that either builds
trust or erodes it. In November 2023, Office‑stamper moved to the
then‑latest LTS baseline, Java 21. For a project stewarded by a single
maintainer and used in sporadic projects inside big companies, this
decision is about more than shiny new language features. It’s about
reducing friction: keeping CI images predictable, aligning with
corporate JDK baselines, and ensuring developers can run the toolchain
on locked‑down machines where “latest” often means “the last approved
LTS.”

An upgrade like this is also a test of engineering hygiene. If
abstractions are clear and tests are meaningful, the code remains
portable across JDKs. If not, a new baseline surfaces brittle
assumptions (reflection quirks, XML factory defaults, module rules).
This migration confirmed the health of our boundaries and pushed
documentation to explicitly state the supported baseline.

# What actually changed

- Raised the project’s Java baseline to 21 and updated build
  configuration to match.

- Adjusted CI workflows to validate the suite on the new baseline across
  supported OS targets.

- Reviewed dependencies for compatibility; documented minimum runtime
  requirements for the CLI and library.

- Tidied a few warnings and modernized minor idioms where it clarified
  intent without adding risk.

The sequence followed a boring playbook: update CI first, run the suite,
address warnings, then bump the declared baseline. This keeps `main`
green and reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong.

# Agile and craftsmanship lens

- Make platform work visible and incremental. Ship upgrades as small
  steps you can reason about.

- Let tests be your leverage. A meaningful suite lets you change the
  ground under your feet without losing balance.

- Prefer clarity over cleverness. Migration time is not the moment to
  introduce exotic flags or plugins.

# Solo maintainer + enterprise usage angle

As a solo maintainer, I need to minimize “works on my machine”
surprises. Aligning with Java 21 means I debug the same baseline many
adopters run. For enterprise teams, this change de‑risks adoption:
platform and security reviews can point to an LTS with known support
windows, and build engineers can use standard images. The fewer custom
knobs we require, the faster a sporadic project can ship.

# Risks and mitigations

- Risk: Behavior changes across JDKs (XML parsing defaults, reflection
  edges). Mitigation: centralize parser factories with explicit, secure
  settings; run tests on multiple vendors where relevant.

- Risk: Downstream users pinned to older JDKs. Mitigation: document
  minimum versions clearly; keep previous release notes accessible;
  offer clear error messages when an unsupported runtime is detected.

- Risk: Slipping scope into refactors. Mitigation: keep the migration
  PRs small; defer opportunistic cleanup to later.

# How to apply this in your project

- Treat platform upgrades as a series: update CI images, align
  compiler/toolchain, fix warnings, then raise the baseline.

- Build a small smoke test suite that reflects your real usage: stamping
  docs, running the CLI, parsing inputs.

- Co‑locate docs and code. When the baseline changes, update the README
  and site pages in the same PR.
