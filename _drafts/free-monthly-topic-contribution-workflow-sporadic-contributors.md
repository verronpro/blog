# Why this topic for September

Office‑stamper is maintained by one person and adopted sporadically
inside big companies. That means outside contributions tend to arrive
once every two or three months—often from engineers who don’t have time
to learn the entire codebase. September is a good moment to document the
contribution workflow that keeps the project welcoming and the
maintenance load sane. These practices are not fancy; they are optimized
for clarity, small batches, and asynchronous collaboration across time
zones and corporate firewalls.

# The problem we’re really solving

“Sporadic contribution” is a different beast from “open‑source at
scale.” Contributors appear, do valuable work for a short window, then
disappear. Without a simple workflow, PRs stall, reviewers forget
context, and the next adopter finds a confusing trail. Meanwhile, as a
solo maintainer, I need an approach that preserves energy for core
engineering rather than process thrash.

# A lightweight, repeatable workflow

- Start with an issue that frames intent Before code, open an issue
  describing the user problem and the proposed direction. Keep it short.
  Include links to the relevant docs pages or Javadoc packages (e.g.,
  `pro.verron.officestamper.api`). If you’re proposing a new processor
  or resolver, sketch the DSL and a tiny example.

- Provide a minimal reproduction or fixture If your change fixes a bug,
  attach a tiny `.docx` that demonstrates the problem. If that’s not
  possible, paste a code snippet that builds a similar tree with
  `WmlFactory` helpers. Repro artifacts are gold: they make reviews and
  tests crisp.

- Slice changes into reviewable PRs Prefer two small PRs over one
  mega‑PR: one for refactors/renames, one for behavior changes. Keep
  each PR focused on a single intent and include a short “why” in the
  description.

- Update docs in the same PR If a change affects user‑visible behavior
  or adds a capability, update the relevant AsciiDoc page and/or
  Javadoc. Treat docs as part of the change, not an afterthought.

- Add a test that locks the behavior Characterization tests with small
  fixtures are ideal. Aim for invariants users care about (e.g., “no
  leftover control comments after stamping this pattern”). Name the test
  so a future reader can guess the scenario.

- Expect asynchronous review Many enterprise networks block GitHub
  notifications. If you don’t get a response within a few days, ping
  once more with a succinct summary and a link to your repro. Keep all
  context in the PR, not private chats.

# Agile and craftsmanship lens

- Small batch size by design: granular PRs reduce cycle time and make
  rollback safe.

- Intent‑revealing artifacts: issues and tests capture “why” and “what,”
  docs capture “how.”

- Shared vocabulary: reuse the names used in Javadoc and site docs;
  avoid synonyms that confuse future readers.

# Solo maintainer + enterprise usage angle

Enterprise contributors often work under constraints (timeboxed sprints,
restricted environments). This workflow honors that reality: it
maximizes the chance that your contribution lands and stays healthy. As
a solo maintainer, I commit to clear triage and honest timelines. When
I’m unavailable, a well‑documented PR with a small repro remains
reviewable by others later. The goal is to make contributions feel like
cooperation rather than a negotiation.

# Practical checklist for your PR

- [ ] One issue describing the problem and intent, with links to docs.

- [ ] One small repro (fixture or `.docx`) or a clear code snippet.

- [ ] One focused PR with tests and updated docs in the same change.

- [ ] CI is green (build + AsciiDoc + tests). If CI is red, add a note
  about what’s failing.

- [ ] Short description that explains the “why” in 2–3 sentences.
