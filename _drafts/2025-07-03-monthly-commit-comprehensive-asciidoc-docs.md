# Why this is July’s most interesting change

Agility is not only how quickly you can change code, but how quickly a
team can build a shared mental model. This commit lands a comprehensive
AsciiDoc documentation set that transforms Office‑stamper from a
powerful library into a teachable platform. By adopting AsciiDoc
end‑to‑end, co‑locating content with the code, and wiring it into the
build, we reduce onboarding friction, compress the feedback loop, and
make refactors safer. That is documentation‑as‑code in its purest form:
knowledge that version‑tracks with the implementation and compiles as
part of the product.

From a craftsmanship perspective, well‑structured docs are a force
multiplier. They allow us to capture invariants, best practices, and
examples once and reuse them across issues, PRs, and support. This
commit also aligns tone and terminology so the API, Javadoc, and site
agree on names and intent—fewer synonyms, fewer confusions, fewer bugs.

# What changed

- Introduced a comprehensive AsciiDoc documentation site with a coherent
  navigation and topic map.

- Documented core concepts (placeholders, comment processors,
  resolvers), configuration, CLI usage, and extension points.

- Ensured examples are copy‑pastable and compile against public API
  types (e.g., `CommentProcessor`, `DocxStamperConfiguration`,
  resolvers).

- Integrated documentation into the Maven build so the site is generated
  consistently in CI.

The documentation is not a brochure; it is a working artifact. By
relying on include files, shared attributes, and code blocks
synchronized with the source, it becomes resilient to API drift.
Reviewers can treat docs changes like code: discuss diffs, enforce
consistency, and test links.

# Agility and DX impact

- Faster onboarding: new contributors ramp up using task‑oriented guides
  rather than spelunking through tests.

- Shorter PR cycles: examples and rationale live next to the code under
  review, so intent is clearer and discussions are focused.

- Safer refactors: when types move or contracts change, the build will
  catch broken links and inconsistent snippets.

# Documentation‑as‑code patterns to emulate

- Co‑location: keep the docs folder in the same repo and PR as the
  change. Tie examples to package names and class symbols you actually
  own.

- Small, runnable snippets: avoid “wall of prose.” Prefer small examples
  that readers can paste into tests.

- Single source: if an explanation exists in Javadoc, link to it in the
  site. If the site offers a longer rationale, link back from Javadoc.
  Eliminate duplication.

- CI as a safety net: build the site, check for broken links, and run
  any snippet‑based tests during pull requests.

# Risks and mitigations

- Risk: documentation rot. Mitigation: make updating docs part of the
  Definition of Done and require reviewer sign‑off on docs for
  user‑visible changes.

- Risk: too much content. Mitigation: maintain a task‑oriented table of
  contents; prune or archive stale pages regularly.

- Risk: uneven voice. Mitigation: add a short style guide (tone,
  terminology, code formatting) and lint with AsciiDoctor presets.

# How to apply this in your project

- Start with a “golden path” series—how to stamp a document, add a
  custom function, and build a simple processor. Then iterate based on
  support questions.

- Attribute and include: use AsciiDoc attributes for product names and
  versions; include code from real files where possible so it never goes
  stale.

- Treat the docs repo as a product. Triage issues, tag them, and measure
  time‑to‑doc for significant features.

This commit raises the organization’s capacity to learn and ship. By
turning tacit knowledge into a maintained, testable asset, we trade
interruptions and folklore for guided, repeatable practice—exactly what
Agile software craftsmanship aims to achieve.
