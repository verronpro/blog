# Why this upgrade matters

Platform upgrades are the software equivalent of “change the engine
while driving.” Moving from Java 21 to 25 keeps the project current with
the ecosystem while validating that our abstractions are portable and
our build is reproducible. For Office‑stamper, the stakes are practical.
The project is maintained by one person and used intermittently in big
companies where security baselines and supported JDKs are set by
centralized platform teams. If the toolchain lags, the friction shows up
as exceptions on locked‑down build agents, more time negotiating with
security, and a higher support load when a sporadic adopter discovers
mismatches. Upgrading on a predictable cadence is part of the product.

# What changed

- Bumped the Java baseline from 21 to 25 across Maven configuration and
  CI workflows.

- Aligned plugin/toolchain versions, compiler flags, and matrix builds
  to reflect the new baseline.

- Ran the full test suite and static analysis on multiple vendors (where
  practical) to catch subtle runtime differences.

- Touched documentation to keep the “Getting started” and CLI notes
  aligned with the new baseline.

The change was deliberately split into small, verifiable steps: update
CI images, bump toolchains, fix any warnings, then raise the project’s
declared baseline. The sequence makes failure modes obvious and keeps
the repo in a releasable state throughout.

# Agile and craftsmanship angles

- Make platform work visible and incremental. A series of small PRs is
  easier to review and to rollback than a single mega‑upgrade. CI stays
  green; users see steady progress.

- Treat tests and static analysis as guardrails. Wide‑reaching changes
  are safe when correctness lives in the test suite and the code is kept
  simple and intention‑revealing.

- Prefer boring choices. For infrastructure decisions, predictability
  beats cleverness. Using the mainstream JDK and widely supported
  plugins reduces surprises for future contributors and enterprise
  adopters.

# Solo maintainer + enterprise usage angle

As a solo maintainer, my goal is to keep the build boring and the
adoption path predictable. Large companies often pin on a specific JDK
for quarters at a time, and they run tools in sandboxed CI where
outbound network access is limited. By aligning Office‑stamper with a
current LTS‑adjacent release and keeping the CI matrix explicit, I
reduce the need for back‑and‑forth when a sporadic team wants to use the
CLI or the engine in a vendor‑controlled environment. The upgrade also
helps me triage issues faster: when a bug report cites Java 25, I’m
debugging on the same baseline.

# Risks and mitigations

- Risk: subtle runtime behavior changes across JDKs (e.g., XML
  processing defaults, reflection edges). Mitigation: run the test suite
  against multiple vendors where possible; centralize XML factory
  creation with explicit secure settings so behavior is uniform.

- Risk: dependency drift and plugin incompatibilities. Mitigation:
  upgrade plugins in lockstep; keep the plugin surface area small;
  prefer widely used versions that receive timely fixes.

- Risk: downstream friction for users stuck on older JDKs. Mitigation:
  document the minimum runtime for the CLI and the engine; provide clear
  error messages when an unsupported JDK is detected; keep previous
  release notes easy to find.

# How to apply this in your team

- Plan upgrades as a sequence of small, independently verifiable steps:
  update CI images, bump the compiler, align plugins, fix warnings, then
  raise the baseline. Ship each step with CI green.

- Build a tiny smoke‑test matrix in CI that exercises critical paths
  (parsing, stamping, CLI execution) on the supported JDKs/vendors your
  users care about.

- Keep documentation co‑located and versioned. When the baseline
  changes, update the docs in the same PR; treat docs as code so
  reviewers can reason about the full impact.
