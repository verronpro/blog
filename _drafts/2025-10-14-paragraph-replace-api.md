# Why this commit is interesting

Replacing text inside Word paragraphs is deceptively tricky—runs split,
styles vary, and comments or fields can interleave. Adding an explicit
`replace` method to `Paragraph` makes text surgery a first-class,
testable API instead of a hand-rolled sequence at every call site.

# What changed

- Introduced `Paragraph.replace` and implemented it for
  `StandardParagraph`.

- Centralized range calculations and validation, reducing duplication
  and subtle bugs.

# Craftsmanship and Agile angle

- Encapsulate complexity behind well-named methods; push correctness
  checks to the boundary.

- Tests now target a single API, improving confidence and speeding up
  reviews.

# How to apply this

- When you find yourself copy-pasting mutation sequences, stop and
  design the API you wish you had.

- Add precondition validation and precise error messages; they pay off
  quickly in triage.
