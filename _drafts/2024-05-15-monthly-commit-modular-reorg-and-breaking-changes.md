# Why this is May’s highlight

Sustainable agility depends on boundaries you can explain and defend. In
May 2024 I undertook a deliberate, sweeping re‑organization: introducing
an `engine` module, relocating core types (notably `DocxStamper` and
`DocxStamperConfiguration`) to their rightful packages, and pruning the
long tail of deprecated APIs. These were breaking changes by design,
communicated as such, because the architecture had evolved to a point
where clarity was worth more than backwards compatibility glue.

For a solo‑maintained project used intermittently in enterprises, this
sort of re‑org is the responsible choice when it reduces incidental
complexity. Contributors arrive every few months; they should find a
layout and namespaces that reveal intent. Users should be able to wire
the engine without spelunking through legacy shims. This month was about
drawing firmer lines so the next year of work could move faster.

# What actually changed

- Introduced a clearer multi‑module structure; code moved under
  `engine/` and `examples/`, with POMs reflecting the new boundaries.

- Moved `DocxStamper` and `DocxStamperConfiguration` to stable packages
  under `pro.verron.officestamper.core` and related namespaces.
  Deprecated packages were removed; import paths are now
  intention‑revealing.

- Removed a suite of deprecated types (e.g., legacy resolvers and
  helpers) that confused discovery and increased the test surface
  without adding value.

- Updated tests, examples, and the site documentation to match the new
  layout and names.

Each change was small and verifiable, but the sequence added up to a
cleaner mental model. The code reads closer to the concepts we teach in
the docs; the docs can link to packages that are meant to be public API;
and the examples compile against the same contracts users should rely
on.

# Agile and craftsmanship lens

- Prefer explicit seams over tacit conventions. Modules and packages are
  user‑facing design decisions; treat them that way.

- Delete to accelerate. Removing deprecated branches reduces decision
  fatigue for contributors and reviewers.

- Communicate breaks with intent. Marking changes as BREAKING in
  messages is a courtesy to adopters and your future self.

# Solo maintainer + enterprise usage angle

Enterprises care about stability and clarity. A leaner, better‑named
engine reduces the cost of security reviews and the chance of misuse
under time pressure. As the sole maintainer, I also get leverage: fewer
shims to carry, fewer places to update, and a smaller surface for
regressions. Because docs are co‑located and built in CI, the repository
becomes a single source of truth about “how to integrate the engine in
2024+.”

# Risks and mitigations

- Risk: Upgrade friction for existing users. Mitigation: provide a
  concise migration guide (old → new package names, removed types,
  recommended replacements) and keep semantic changes minimal.

- Risk: Missed internal coupling after moves. Mitigation: run the full
  suite, build the site, and add characterization tests around hot paths
  before and after moves.

- Risk: Over‑eager deletions. Mitigation: remove in stages; prefer
  deprecate → migrate → delete across minor releases.

# How to apply this in your project

- Map your code by responsibilities and change frequency. Move toward
  modules/namespaces that reflect those boundaries.

- Remove deprecated code once migration paths exist; every extra path is
  cognitive debt.

- Update docs and examples in the same PR as the moves. Treat broken
  links as build failures.
