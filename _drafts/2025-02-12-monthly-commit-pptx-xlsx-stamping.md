# Why this is February’s highlight

Agility is about meeting users where they are. Many organizations don’t
live in a Word‑only world—presentations and spreadsheets are part of
their daily workflows. This commit brings PowerPoint (PPTX) and Excel
(XLSX) stamping to Office‑stamper, along with CLI improvements that make
the new capabilities immediately accessible. It widens the product’s
aperture without bloating the core: the engine remains focused on robust
stamping semantics while format‑specific details are encapsulated at the
boundary.

From a software craftsmanship perspective, adding formats is risky when
it leaks implementation quirks throughout the codebase. The design here
keeps responsibilities clean. The engine exposes consistent abstractions
(placeholders, resolvers, processors where applicable), and the format
adapters/CLI do the heavy lifting to translate user inputs into those
abstractions. Users gain power; the core stays cohesive.

# What changed

- Introduced PowerPoint stamping support to programmatically fill
  presentation templates.

- Added Excel stamping support to populate sheets and ranges, aligning
  with placeholder semantics users already know.

- Improved CLI experience so the new formats are first‑class: clearer
  flags, examples, and helpful error messages.

- Preserved a stable, format‑agnostic engine surface so business logic
  doesn’t fork by file type.

# Agility and developer experience

- Broader value, same mental model: teams can standardize on a single
  templating approach across documents, slides, and spreadsheets. That
  translates into fewer tools to learn and less context switching.

- Smaller learning curve: existing knowledge (e.g., placeholders,
  expression evaluation) applies across formats. Docs and examples scale
  better because the core ideas are shared.

- Cleaner PRs: format handling lives in adapters and the CLI, allowing
  targeted changes and tests per format without touching the engine’s
  heart.

This change also advances documentation‑as‑code. Each new capability
ships with examples and CLI guidance aligned with the engine’s
terminology. When users run `--help` or check the docs, they see the
same nouns and verbs used throughout the codebase.

# Practical guidance

- Treat each file format as a boundary module. Translate external
  representation (slide placeholders, cell ranges) into the engine’s
  abstract operations and back—nowhere else.

- Provide format‑specific examples in the docs that mirror common user
  tasks (e.g., “populate a quarterly results deck,” “fill a forecast
  spreadsheet”). Keep them minimal and runnable.

- Validate your abstractions by attempting the same business task across
  formats. If you can stamp the same dataset into DOCX, PPTX, and XLSX
  with similar commands, you’ve likely landed on a good model.

# Risks and mitigations

- Risk: feature skew—Word features not yet available in slides/sheets.
  Mitigation: document current parity transparently; maintain a public
  matrix and prioritize based on user demand.

- Risk: performance pitfalls on large workbooks or media‑heavy decks.
  Mitigation: profile real files, stream where possible, and add tests
  capturing memory constraints.

- Risk: UX fragmentation in the CLI. Mitigation: reuse flag names and
  error patterns; keep subcommands parallel across formats.

# How to apply this thinking

- Start with domain language, not file types. Define the operations
  users need (insert text, table, image, repeat section), then map them
  across formats.

- Keep your engine ignorant of transport: it should not know if the
  caller is Word, PowerPoint, or Excel. That ignorance is what keeps the
  design resilient as the product evolves.

This commit is a pragmatic expansion. It increases the usefulness of the
tool without diluting its conceptual core, allowing teams to move faster
across a wider set of business documents with a single, learnable
approach.
