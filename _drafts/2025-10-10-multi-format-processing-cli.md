# Why this commit stands out

Teams live in heterogeneous data worlds. By teaching the CLI to process
CSV, JSON, XML/HTML, and Java properties, we meet users where their data
already is. This is pragmatic agility: reduce integration friction
first, then refine. The change makes the CLI a better front door for
sporadic enterprise adopters—no need to write convertors or custom
scripts before you see value. You point the CLI to a template and a data
file in the format you already have.

For a solo‑maintained project, the key is leverage with safety. Format
differences are handled by small adapters at the boundary; the engine’s
domain stays stable. That means clearer tests, fewer places for bugs to
hide, and a user experience that feels cohesive across formats.

# What actually changed

- Extended the CLI’s input adapters to parse multiple common formats
  (CSV, JSON, XML/HTML, Java properties).

- Unified the stamping flow so format differences do not leak into
  downstream logic; the engine sees the same abstraction.

- Improved CLI help and error messages with minimal, copy‑pastable
  examples for each format.

- Updated docs and examples so teams can adopt the new capability
  without spelunking through source.

# Agile/craftsmanship/docs‑as‑code lens

- Optimize for first value. A single CLI that accepts the data you
  already have compresses onboarding; fewer handoffs, less yak‑shaving.

- Keep the engine pure. Adapters live at the edges; the domain model
  (placeholders, resolvers, processors) remains format‑agnostic, which
  preserves testability and refactor safety.

- Documentation‑as‑code. Examples ship with the change and compile
  against public API; the site and `--help` show the same vocabulary.

# Solo‑maintainer + enterprise usage angle

Enterprises often have strict pipelines and legacy data sources. Giving
the CLI first‑class support for common formats removes reasons to fork
or wrap the tool. As the sole maintainer, I avoid a support queue of
“how do I convert X to Y?” Instead, I can point to a tiny example per
format and a stable interface. Platform teams reviewing the tool can
scan the adapters once and approve their use across projects.

# Risks and mitigations

- Risk: Adapter sprawl and inconsistent behavior. Mitigation: keep
  adapters small, tested, and documented; enforce a single abstraction
  at the engine boundary.

- Risk: Divergent error reporting per format. Mitigation: normalize
  error messages and exit codes; add tests per adapter.

- Risk: Performance on very large inputs. Mitigation: stream where
  applicable; document limits and provide guidance.

# How to apply this in your project

- Treat format support as adapters at the boundary. Keep the domain
  model stable and format‑agnostic.

- Provide helpful error messages and minimal examples for each format in
  the docs and `--help` output.

- Add a smoke test per format that exercises the happy path. Keep
  samples tiny and vendor‑neutral.
