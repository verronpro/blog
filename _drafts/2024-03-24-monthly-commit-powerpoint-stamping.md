# Why this is March’s highlight

Agility often means meeting users where they already work. In many
enterprises, important narratives live in slide decks as much as in
documents. In March 2024, Office‑stamper grew beyond Word: this commit
implemented support for stamping PowerPoint (PPTX) presentations. The
goal was not to clone every Word feature in slides; it was to prove that
our core abstractions—placeholders, resolvers, and a clean
traversal/execution pipeline—scale to a second format without leaking
format‑specific quirks back into the engine.

For a solo‑maintained project with sporadic, enterprise‑grade usage,
this is the kind of extension that adds surface area while testing the
quality of the model. If the model is right, new formats feel like
adapters at the edges, not invasive forks in the middle. This work
validated that design.

# What actually changed

- Introduced a first implementation of PowerPoint stamping with a
  dedicated visitor and adapter layer.

- Mapped slide placeholders and text runs to the engine’s placeholder
  resolution semantics, preserving the same mental model users already
  know from DOCX.

- Ensured examples and tests exercise realistic slide scenarios (titles,
  bullets, notes) with the same resolver APIs.

- Kept the engine surface format‑agnostic; PPTX behavior is
  encapsulated, with clear seams for evolution.

The result is pragmatic interoperability: teams can reuse data and
scripts to stamp both documents and decks with minimal relearning. Docs
and tests were updated in lockstep so adopters can copy examples and
iterate quickly.

# Agile and craftsmanship lens

- One language, many canvases: keeping the domain model stable
  (placeholders, resolvers, pre/post processing) across formats reduces
  cognitive load for users and contributors. That is a craftsmanship
  win.

- Slice by capability, not by file type: the first PPTX milestone
  focuses on text content with a high signal‑to‑noise ratio. Broader
  media or layout features can follow behind stable seams.

- Tests as truth: behavior is locked by fixtures and characterization
  tests so future refactors remain safe.

# Solo maintainer + enterprise usage angle

Enterprises often need a quarterly results deck and a narrative report
that share numbers and labels. Supporting PPTX means those workflows can
standardize on Office‑stamper and a single pipeline. As a solo
maintainer, I can guide users to the same set of concepts and helper
APIs across formats, shortening support conversations and avoiding
divergent docs. Because format specifics are isolated behind adapters, I
can evolve slide support safely in small PRs without risking DOCX
stability.

# Risks and mitigations

- Risk: Feature skew (Word features not yet present in slides).
  Mitigation: document parity clearly; maintain a capability matrix;
  prioritize based on user demand.

- Risk: Performance on media‑heavy decks. Mitigation: profile real
  decks; bound traversal; avoid quadratic behavior when modifying
  runs/shapes.

- Risk: API leakage across formats. Mitigation: keep the engine domain
  pure; add format‑specific adapters at the boundary and test both
  sides.

# How to apply this in your project

- Start with the shared language of your domain (insert text, repeat
  section, resolve image) and map it across formats.

- Keep adapters narrow and explicit; push complexity to pre/post
  processors when possible.

- Document and test the “golden path” first: stamp a small deck with
  text placeholders and bullets. Expand from there.
