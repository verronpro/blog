# About Joseph

I’m Joseph Verron. I help software teams build reliable systems and clear documentation. My work sits at the intersection of software craftsmanship and docs‑as‑code: practical techniques, repeatable pipelines, and small improvements that compound over time.

Over the years I’ve worked across banking, insurance, energy, and communications. I care about maintainability, safe refactoring, and the kind of tooling that makes quality the default.

## Interests
- Docs‑as‑Code pipelines and governance
- Template semantics (Word/PowerPoint) and invariants
- Testing strategies and characterization tests
- Developer experience, automation, and CI/CD

If you’re curious about what I’m working on, the home page highlights recent posts; the full list is in the Archive.
